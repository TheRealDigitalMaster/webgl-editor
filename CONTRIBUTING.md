# Contributing

Pull requests are more than welcome! There are very few rules, and here they
are:

- Write [beautiful commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- JavaScript code adheres to the [Airbnb style
  guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- HTML attributes should be on separate lines, and indented, like this:

```html
<!-- bad -->
<my-custom-element id="special" class="snowflake" animation-status={{animationStatus}}></my-custom-element>

<!-- good -->
<my-custom-element
  id="special"
  class="snowflake"
  animation-status={{animationStatus}}>
</my-custom-element>
```
