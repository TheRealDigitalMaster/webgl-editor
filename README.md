## 3D modeling made easy with Polymer and three.js

### Introduction

This project aims to to make 3D content creation **easy** and **accessible** to
everyone by leveraging modern web technologies in order to provide a simplified
UI for people who are considering working with 3D content as a career or hobby.
It is heavily inspired by the work of [arodic](https://github.com/arodic).

### Quick start

This guide assumes you have Node.js and Bower installed globally. To install
Bower, run:

```sh
npm install --global bower
```

Everything else relies on `npm` scripts. The following can be run:

- `npm run setup` fetches all the required dependencies
- `npm run server` spins up a server that listens on `http://localhost:8080/`
- `npm run lint` checks for style errors using [JSCS](http://jscs.info/)
